# Changelog

This changelog documents the version ranges that should be treated as deprecated and the current stable line for each published Sculptor package.

## Deprecated Versions

### `@sculptor/router`

- Deprecated: `0.2.0` through `0.2.4`
- Current stable: `0.2.5`

Reason:

- Earlier router releases predate the final `@Patch()` support, functional router ergonomics, and bootstrap-time route collision detection.
- Those versions are more likely to surface duplicate route registrations, stale generated output, and weaker route diagnostics.

### `@sculptor/core`

- Deprecated: `0.2.0` through `0.2.2`
- Current stable: `0.2.3`

Reason:

- Earlier core releases predate the stabilized request context, non-listening bootstrap mode, and centralized framework error hook.
- Those versions are more likely to expose bootstrap/runtime inconsistencies in generated apps.

### `@sculptor/cli`

- Deprecated: `0.2.0`
- Current stable: `0.2.2`

Reason:

- The older CLI release predates the current config command set and the updated route/handler generation contract.
- It also assumes the older template layout, which can break installs and scaffold output in current workspaces.

### `@sculptor/template-registry`

- Deprecated: `0.1.0` through `0.1.4`
- Current stable: `0.1.5`

Reason:

- Earlier template-registry releases predate the registry split, the current template file layout, and the standardized route/handler scaffolds.
- Those versions can produce stale generated files or miss the files the CLI now expects to load.
