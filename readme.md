SculptorTS is a TypeScript-first, Express-based framework for building APIs with decorator controllers, functional routers, or both together.

The `v1.1.4` release line introduces a package-aware architecture with a native Express builder that is:

- explicit
- registry-aware
- scanner-aware
- AI-aware
- DI-enabled
- hybrid-friendly
- Express-native
- backwards-compatible with `v1.0.x`

The framework is split into focused packages:

- `@sculptor/core` for runtime startup, request context, registry flattening, and server bootstrapping
- `@sculptor/di` for explicit dependency injection and package metadata
- `@sculptor/router` for decorators and route assembly
- `@sculptor/config` for config loading
- `@sculptor/template-registry` for scaffold templates and generator assets
- `@sculptor/paws` for logging with dog mode personalities
- `@sculptor/cli` for scaffolding, generation, diagnostics, sync, and app commands


If you are new to the framework, read this file first, then move into the package docs linked below.

## Hidden Behavior Worth Knowing

- Hybrid package scaffolds intentionally generate the functional route under `"/r/<package>"` to avoid route collisions with the package controller.
- The runtime converts thrown values into JSON error responses instead of leaving Express to render HTML error pages.
- `req.ctx` is attached by the framework bootstrap before routes run.
- Functional, class-based, and middleware errors all follow the same framework error pipeline.

## Package-First Architecture

Package indexes are the primary composition contract in SculptorTS.

Each package owns:

- exports
- runtime composition
- scanner metadata
- package metadata
- rebuild metadata
- helper-linked file metadata

The package index lives at `src/<package>/index.ts` and is decorated with `@Package({...})`.

Sculptor keeps runtime ownership lightweight:

- `src/registry.ts` composes the app globally
- `sculptor.packages.json` records package ownership and file tracking
- the runtime flattens package registrations internally
- generators update only the generated regions in package indexes

The supported app styles remain:

- functional
- decorator
- hybrid

Packages are first-class, but they are still optional. Functional and unpackaged code continue to work.

Generation defaults are mode-aware:

- class mode stays class-based by default
- functional mode emits functional services, repositories, routes, and package factories
- hybrid mode keeps class-based defaults unless `--functional`, `-f`, `-fun`, or `--fun` is requested

## How The Framework Is Structured

### `@sculptor/core`

This is the runtime entrypoint.

What it does:

- starts the Express server
- exposes a strongly typed Express builder through `createApp()`
- loads config from `sculptor.json`, `props.json`, and `.env`
- discovers the app root automatically when `rootDir` is not supplied
- flattens package and registry composition into runtime arrays
- exposes `req.ctx` as the default request context
- exposes framework error hooks
- supports `startApp({ listen: false })` for validation-only startup
- supports both `startApp({ rootDir })` and `startApp({ app })`

How it is used:

- `src/main.ts` imports `startApp()` from `@sculptor/core`
- the app imports `registry` from `src/registry.ts`
- the runtime starts from the app root

You will find it here:

- [packages/core/README.md](packages/core/README.md)
- [packages/core/src/runtime.ts](packages/core/src/runtime.ts)
- [packages/core/src/index.ts](packages/core/src/index.ts)

### `@sculptor/di`

This is the explicit DI layer.

What it does:

- defines `@Service()`, `@Repository()`, `@Middleware()`, `@Package()`, and `@AutoInject()`
- resolves singleton dependencies lazily
- supports constructor and property injection
- detects circular dependencies
- exposes package metadata for package-aware runtime composition
- exposes functional package and handler types for generator output and hybrid packages

How it is used:

- decorate injectables with `@Service()` or `@Repository()`
- mark package index classes with `@Package({...})`
- inject dependencies only where `@AutoInject(...)` is present

You will find it here:

- [packages/di/README.md](packages/di/README.md)
- [packages/di/src/index.ts](packages/di/src/index.ts)

### `@sculptor/router`

This is the router layer.

What it does:

- provides `@Controller`, `@Get`, `@Patch`, `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Delete`, and `@Use`
- turns decorated classes into Express routes
- supports controller-based, hybrid, and Sculptor-native functional routing

How it is used:

- decorate a class with `@Controller("/health")`
- decorate methods with `@Get("/")` or other HTTP verbs
- add `@Use()` at class or method level for middleware

You will find it here:

- [packages/router/README.md](packages/router/README.md)
- [packages/router/src/index.ts](packages/router/src/index.ts)
- [packages/router/src/router.ts](packages/router/src/router.ts)

### `@sculptor/config`

This is the config system.

What it does:

- reads `sculptor.json` for framework behavior
- reads `props.json` for runtime settings
- loads `.env` values, resolves `${VAR}` interpolation, and redacts sensitive config when needed
- merges framework defaults, project config, runtime config, and overrides in a predictable order
- exposes direct lookup helpers

You will find it here:

- [packages/config/README.md](packages/config/README.md)
- [packages/config/src/config.ts](packages/config/src/config.ts)

### `@sculptor/paws`

This is the logger.

What it does:

- prints standard logs, system logs, warnings, and errors
- supports dog mode with Bruno, Coki, and Dodie personalities
- reads `logging.enabled` and `logging.dogMode` from `sculptor.json`

You will find it here:

- [packages/paws/README.md](packages/paws/README.md)
- [packages/paws/src/paws.ts](packages/paws/src/paws.ts)

### `@sculptor/cli`

This is the CLI.

What it does:

- creates new apps
- generates package-aware and unpackaged resources
- runs dev, build, lint, test, sync, doctor, and package commands
- maintains `sculptor.packages.json`
- generates `AGENTS.md`
- updates only the globally installed `@sculptor/cli` with `sc update`
- recovers missing template-registry installs when global installs are incomplete
- resolves files exactly for register/unregister/remove workflows

| Set `testing.generate` to `false` | New generated resources only get source files |
| Set `PORT=4000` | The runtime uses `4000` unless you override it explicitly |
| Set `app.prefix="/api"` | The router is mounted under `/api` |

## Quick Start

```bash
sc new demo-app
cd demo-app
sc dev
```

Then:

```bash
sc g c user
sc sync
sc test
```

## Default Generated Layout

When TDD generation is enabled, a new scaffold includes:

- `src/tests/main.spec.ts`
- `src/tests/health.controller.spec.ts` in decorator or hybrid mode
- `src/tests/health.route.spec.ts` in functional or hybrid mode
- `src/tests/registry.ts`
- `src/tests/runner.ts`

The test harness automatically rewrites itself when new generated specs are added.

## Runtime Output

The runtime prints:

```text
SculptorTS listening on port X
Local: http://localhost:X
```

If the server binds to `0`, the runtime prints the actual bound port.

## App Root Rule

The CLI has two groups of commands:

### Allowed from outside a Sculptor app

- `sc new`
- `sc agents`
- `sc agents refresh`
- `sc help`
- `sc version`
- `sc doctor`
- `sc update`
- `sc update project`
- `sc report`

### Allowed only inside a Sculptor app

- `sc start`
- `sc dev`
- `sc build`
- `sc lint`
- `sc test`
- `sc generate`
- `sc g`
- `sc sync`
- `sc ls`
- `sc pkg`
- `sc package`
- `sc update project`
- `sc reg`
- `sc ureg`
- `sc rm`

If a restricted command runs without `sculptor.json` in the current directory, the CLI stops immediately.
