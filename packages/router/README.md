# @sculptor/router

The SculptorTS router package provides decorators and router assembly for controller-based and hybrid app styles.

## Version Policy

- Release line: `v0.3.x`
- The router package keeps the controller, hybrid, and functional routing contract stable in the package-aware runtime line.

## What This Package Does

- Defines controller and method decorators
- Attaches middleware metadata to classes and methods
- Scans decorated controllers
- Builds an Express router from controller classes and router instances
- Exposes a Sculptor-style functional router builder

## Public API

```ts
import {
  Controller,
  Get,
  Patch,
  Post,
  Put,
  Delete,
  Use,
  FunctionalRouter,
  createRouter
} from "@sculptor/router";
```

## Decorators

### `Controller(prefix)`

Marks a class as a controller and stores its route prefix.

If you omit the prefix, it defaults to `/`.

### `Get(path)`, `Post(path)`, `Put(path)`, `Delete(path)`

Attach HTTP method metadata to a controller method.

If you omit the path, it defaults to `/`.

### `Patch(path)`

Attach `PATCH` method metadata to a controller method.

### `Use(...middlewares)`

Attaches Express middleware.

If you use `Use()` on a class, the middleware applies to all routes in that controller.

If you use `Use()` on a method, the middleware applies only to that route.

### `FunctionalRouter(prefix)`

Creates a Sculptor-native functional router scope.

You usually do not need to annotate the returned value. Use it like Express:

```ts
const users = FunctionalRouter("/users");
```

- `users.get(handler)` registers `GET /users`
- `users.get("/verify-token", handler)` registers a child route under the same scope
- `users.at("/verify-token").patch(handler)` registers a nested scoped route
- `users.use(auth)` applies middleware to later routes in the same scope
- `users.use("/audit", auth)` mounts middleware at a scoped sub-path
- `users.use(errorHandler)` can mount an Express error handler for the scope
- the returned scope type is `FunctionalRouterScope`

## Router Assembly

`createRouter()` accepts:

- `controllers`
- `routes`
- `prefix`

It returns an Express router.

It also detects duplicate registrations before the server starts. If two routes resolve to the same method and path, Sculptor throws a framework error with source labels when available.

### Controller Path Behavior

When you pass controller classes, the router:

1. Instantiates each controller
2. Scans its metadata
3. Registers all decorated routes

### Route Path Behavior

When you pass Express routers in `routes`, they are mounted directly onto the resulting router.

### Prefix Behavior

If you pass a prefix:

- it is normalized to a leading slash
- trailing slashes are removed
- the router is mounted under that prefix

If you do not pass a prefix, the router is returned unwrapped.

## Behavior Matrix

| If you do this | Then this happens |
| --- | --- |
| Add `@Controller("/health")` | The controller routes are grouped under `/health` |
| Add `@Get("/")` to a method | The method is registered for `GET /` relative to the controller prefix |
| Add `@Patch("/")` to a method | The method is registered for `PATCH /` relative to the controller prefix |
| Add `@Use(logger)` to a controller class | Every controller route uses `logger` |
| Add `@Use(auth)` to a single method | Only that route uses `auth` |
| Pass `prefix: "/api"` to `createRouter` | The mounted router appears under `/api` |
| Pass `prefix: "api"` | The prefix is normalized to `/api` |
| Pass `prefix: "/api/"` | The trailing slash is removed |
| Pass an error handler to `users.use(...)` | The router can surface scoped error middleware |
| Pass no controllers and no routes | An empty router is returned |
| Pass both controllers and routes | Both styles are mounted into one router |
| Register the same method and path twice | Bootstrap fails with a typed route-collision error |

## Example

```ts
import { Controller, FunctionalRouter, Get, createRouter } from "@sculptor/router";

@Controller("/health")
class HealthController {
  @Get("/")
  health() {
    return { status: "ok" };
  }
}

const router = createRouter({
  controllers: [HealthController],
  routes: [],
  prefix: "/api"
});

const users = FunctionalRouter("/users");
users.get((req, res) => res.json([]));
users.at("/verify-token").patch((req, res) => res.json({ ok: true }));
```

## Types

The package exports the core router types used by the framework:

- `ControllerClass`
- `ControllerMetadata`
- `CreateRouterOptions`
- `Err`
- `HttpMethod`
- `Nxt`
- `MethodRouteMetadata`
- `ParameterResolverContext`
- `Req`
- `Res`
- `RouteDefinition`
- `FunctionalRouterScope` as the public scoped-router type
- `FunctionalRouterLike` as a compatibility alias
- `RouterSource`

## Package Scripts

- `npm run build` compiles the package
- `npm run prepack` builds before publish
