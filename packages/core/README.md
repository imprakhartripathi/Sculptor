# @sculptor/core

The SculptorTS core package boots the HTTP server and exposes the primary framework runtime API.

## What This Package Does

- Starts an Express server from a registry
- Loads runtime config and framework config
- Creates the app router from controllers and routes
- Exposes the shared registry shape used by scaffolded apps
- Exposes `bootstrapApp({ listen: false })` for validation and CI flows

## Public API

```ts
import { createRouter, FunctionalRouter, startApp, registry } from "@sculptor/core";
```

### `startApp(options)`

Starts the app and returns the Node HTTP server.

Options:

- `registry`: the app registry
- `rootDir`: app root, defaults to `process.cwd()`
- `port`: optional explicit port override

### `registry`

The default empty registry shape exported by the package.

### Re-exports

`@sculptor/core` also re-exports the router decorators and config helpers:

- `Controller`
- `Get`
- `Patch`
- `Post`
- `Put`
- `Delete`
- `Use`
- `FunctionalRouter`
- `createRouter`
- `loadConfig`
- `getConfig`

## Startup Behavior

When `startApp()` runs:

1. `sculptor.json` and `props.json` are loaded from the app root
2. The runtime chooses a port
3. Express middleware is attached
4. The registry is turned into an Express router
5. The server begins listening, unless `listen: false` is requested
6. The runtime logs the port and localhost URL

Startup output:

```text
SculptorTS listening on port X
Local: http://localhost:X
```

## Port Resolution

Port resolution uses this order:

1. `startApp({ port })`
2. `process.env.PORT`
3. `props.json` `app.port`
4. `3000`

If the resolved port is `0`, the runtime reads the actual bound port from the server address and prints that instead.

## Registry Behavior

| If the registry contains | Then the runtime does this |
| --- | --- |
| Controllers | Scans the controller metadata and registers decorator-based routes |
| Routes | Mounts the Express routers directly |
| Both controllers and routes | Combines both into one app router |
| No routes | Starts a server, but nothing is mounted beyond Express body parsing |

## Config Behavior

| If `props.json` says | Then the runtime does this |
| --- | --- |
| `app.port = 4000` | The app listens on `4000` unless `PORT` or `startApp({ port })` overrides it |
| `app.prefix = "/api"` | The router is mounted under `/api` |
| No `app.prefix` | The router is mounted at the root |

## Example

```ts
import { registry, startApp } from "@sculptor/core";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

const rootDir = fileURLToPath(new URL("..", import.meta.url));

await startApp({
  registry,
  rootDir,
  port: 3000
});
```

## Behavior Matrix

| If you do this | Then this happens |
| --- | --- |
| Call `startApp()` with no port | The runtime uses environment and config defaults |
| Pass `port: 0` | The OS chooses a free port and the runtime reports the actual port |
| Pass a registry with controllers | Decorator metadata is scanned and registered |
| Pass a registry with routes | Route routers are mounted directly |
| Pass a registry with functional routers | Functional builders are converted to Express routers |
| Use `loadConfig()` | Framework and runtime config are loaded and cached per root directory |
| Use `getConfig("app.port")` | The merged runtime value is returned if present |
